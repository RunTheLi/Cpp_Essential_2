Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

modelling real-world entities in C++,
the usage of objects, classes in C++;
verifying user input;
useful and informative data presentation.
Scenario
This task will be a little more free-form than the previous ones.

We want you to design and write a game!

First, think of the type of game you want to design:

maybe a classic pen-and-paper game like Battleships or Tic-tac-toe;
or maybe a word game like Hangman;
or some simple board game like Ludo;
or even a card game like Blackjack
The game does not need to be fancy, but think of the following things when you work:

how can you present the game in a user-friendly way?
which elements of the game can be modelled using classes and objects?
do you see any space for common interfaces that can be shared by more than one class?
That's it. Go on, have fun!
