Scenario
Write a class which holds matrices of different sizes and create methods to:

add a value to a matrix (add a value to each individual cell of the matrix);
add two matrices, and if their sizes are different, throw an exception;
subtract a value from a matrix (subtract a value from each individual cell of thematrix);
subtract two matrices, and if their sizes are different, throw an exception;
multiply a value by a matrix (multiply a value by each individual cell of the matrix);
multiply two matrices, and if the row count of the first matrix is different to the column count of the second matrix, throw an exception.
Add an overloaded operator to each of the methods above. In the main function, perform a few operations with operators only.

Create two matrices, one with 1 in all cells, and another with 3 in all cells. Perform all operations, and print all indirect results.

After testing this scenario, add a third matrix with a different size to the first one. Try to make your code throw all possible exceptions.

Sample Input
Enter the operation you want to perform (add, subtract, multiply): subtract
Enter the number of rows for Matrix A: 2
Enter the number of columns for Matrix A: 2
Enter the values for Matrix A:
Enter value at position [0][0]: 1
Enter value at position [0][1]: 1
Enter value at position [1][0]: 2
Enter value at position [1][1]: 2
Enter the number of rows for Matrix B: 2
Enter the number of columns for Matrix B: 2
Enter the values for Matrix B:
Enter value at position [0][0]: 3
Enter value at position [0][1]: 3
Enter value at position [1][0]: 3
Enter value at position [1][1]: 3

Expected output
Matrix A:
1 1 
2 2 
 
Matrix B:
3 3 
3 3 
 
After subtraction:
-2 -2 
-1 -1
