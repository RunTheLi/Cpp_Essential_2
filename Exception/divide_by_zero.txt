Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

identifying situations when exceptions are thrown;
adding code to handle exceptions.
Scenario
Insert a try-catch block into this program to solve potential problems with arithmetic operations. Remember to inform the user of any exceptions in simple words.

Sample Input

Expected output
2

Sample Input

0
Expected output
Your input is not valid, you can't divide by zero.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class DivideByZeroException : public exception {
public:
    const char* what() const throw() {
        return "Your input is not valid, you can't divide by zero.";
    }
};

int main() {
    int numerator, denominator;
    cout << "Enter numerator: ";
    cin >> numerator;
    cout << "Enter denominator: ";
    cin >> denominator;
    
    try {
        if (denominator == 0) {
            throw DivideByZeroException();
        }
        // your code here
    
    return 0;
}
