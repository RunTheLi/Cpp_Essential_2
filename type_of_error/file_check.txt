Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

situations when exceptions are thrown;
handling file-related exceptions.
Scenario
Write a class that holds a (2×2) matrix, and add two methods to work with files: one method to load the matrix from a file (in any format) and one method to save the matrix to a file (in the same format).

Add code to handle exceptional situations (file not found and no rights to file), print a message and re-throw an exception.

Add a try-catch block in the proper places.

Simulate both situations handled (try to load a nonexistent file, and try to save a file in a path where you have no proper rights).

Expected output
Simulate both situations handled:

File not found at: path
No rights to write to file: path
