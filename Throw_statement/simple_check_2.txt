Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

situations when exceptions are thrown;
throwing exceptions;
handling exceptions.
Scenario
Write a very simple class to hold one value and its boundaries (limits of the value in integer numbers), add one method to add a value to the one held in the instance of class, and one method to subtract a value from the one held in the object.

In both methods, throw an exception when a value exceeds the limits.

In the main function create two objects and test them with different scenarios.

Print the values held at the end of the program. Add adequate try-catch blocks and an appropriate message.
