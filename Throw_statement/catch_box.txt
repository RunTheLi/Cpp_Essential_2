Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

handling exceptions;
writing his/her own exception classes;
passing additional information in exceptions;
Scenario
Write a program that calculates the area of some simple figures (i.e. a square and a rectangle). One function per figure.

Check if the function arguments are greater than 0 – if they aren't, throw an exception.

This program should use your own exceptions to communicate with a higher-level code.

Add some attribute in your exception to pass a message to the user. Some boilerplate code is included below.

Expected output
Your input is not valid. The area can't be negative.

// Base Code //
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
//add your own exception class here
//add functions code here
int main(void) {
	float a, b, r;
	cin >> a;
	cin >> b;
	try
	{
		float rsquare = square_area(a);
		float rrectangle = rectangle_area(a,b);
		cout << rsquare << endl << rrectangle << endl;
	}
	//add a suitable catch block here
	return 0;
}
