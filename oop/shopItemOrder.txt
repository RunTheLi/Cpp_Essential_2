Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

defining a C++ class from scratch;
modelling real-world entities with classes and objects.
Scenario
One aspect of encapsulation is setting the data in the object, but there is another aspect to it.

Now that you have the basics, try to implement your own C++ class!

Let's say we're building an e-commerce site and you are tasked with implementing a single-item order in a shopping cart.

Your class should be named ShopItemOrder.
The item order shall store the following information:
item name;
item unit price;
number of items ordered.
There will be access methods allowing to:
get and set all of the above information;
get the total price for the order;
print the order in a user-friendly way.
You can take any approach to calculating the total price.
