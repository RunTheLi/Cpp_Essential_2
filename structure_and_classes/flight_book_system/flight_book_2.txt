Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

modelling real-world entities with classes and objects;
limiting acceptable input range.
Scenario
Let's continue working on our booking system.

You may remember in our last task that we had no limit on the number of reserved seats.

Airlines often allow the overbooking of flights, expecting that some passengers will not make it.

Modify the constructor so that it will not allow more than 105% reservation of the total capacity.

Also for a negative number of reservations, set the number to 0.

We might also want to be able to add new reservations or cancel them. Provide a way for the user to do this via a simple interface.

The command "add [n]" will try to add n reservations to the flight.
The command "cancel [n]" will try to cancel n reservations from the flight.
If an operation fails for any reason, the program will issue the message "Cannot perform this operation"
The command "quit" will stop execution of the program.
Use the code from the previous lab as a starting point.

Sample Input
100
50
add 4
cancel 200
quit

Expected output
Flight 1 : 50/100 (50%) seats reserved
Flight 1 : 54/100 (54%) seats reserved
Cannot perform this operation

Sample Input
180
200
add 1
quit

Expected output
Flight 1 : 189/180 (105%) seats reserved
Cannot perform this operation
