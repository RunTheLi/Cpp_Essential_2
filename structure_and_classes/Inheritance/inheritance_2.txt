Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

inheritance syntax and operation;
sharing functionality between objects using inheritance.
Scenario
Let's continue with our farm example from the previous lab.

Create classes representing cows, sheep and horses:

a sheep will consume about 1.1 liters of water per day per 10 kg of weight;
a horse will consume about 6.8 liters of water per day per 100 kg of weight;
a cow will consume about 8.6 liters of water per day per 100 kg of weight.
Your program should read lines of text in the following form: "[animal] [weigth]".

When your program encounters an empty line, it should print the total water consumption and exit.

Sample Input
cow 500
sheep 80
horse 400

Expected output
