Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

modelling real-world entities with classes and objects;
interactions between objects of the same type.
Scenario
A point in two-dimensional space can be represented by two coordinates, usually denoted as x and y.

The distance between two points in space can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

Your program should read two sets of x and y coordinates and calculate the distance between the two points the sets represent.
