Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

modelling real-world entities with classes and objects;
interactions between objects of the same type;
creating objects based on objects of other objects of custom classes.
Scenario
A line in two-dimensional space can be represented by two parameters, the slope and the y-intercept.

If we represent the slope as a and the y-intercept as b, then all points that belong to that line can be expressed by the equation y = ax + b.

Knowing two points that belong to a line, we are able to calculate the slope and the y-intercept of the line.

Your program should read two sets of x and y coordinates and construct an object of the class Line2D, based on those two points.

Output the line in the form y = [slope]x [+-] [y_intercept]
