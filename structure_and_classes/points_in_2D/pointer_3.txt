Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

modelling real-world entities with classes and objects;
interactions between objects of the same type.
Scenario
Use the code from the previous exercise as a starting point.

It's sometimes useful in computer graphics to detect if three or more points in a 2D space are collinear.

Use the code from your previous example and add the method contains() to the Line2D class that will check if a given point belongs to that line.

Your program should read in two sets of x and y coordinates and construct an object of the class Line2D based on those two points.

Then, your program should read a third point and determine if it's a part of the same line.

The output of your program should just be the verdict "collinear" or "not collinear".

Remember that comparing floating-point values in C++ might be a bit tricky.
