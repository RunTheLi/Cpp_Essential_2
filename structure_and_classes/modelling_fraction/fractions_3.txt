Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

interactions between objects of the same type.
Scenario
Let's finish working on our fraction representations.

As the last task, we'll add the ability to compare fractions.

Your program should read two fractions and then print out the result of the comparison of those two fractions.

When displaying fractions, they should now be reduced to their lowest terms, so "2/4" should be replaced with "1/2".

Sample Input

1 / 3
Expected output
3/4 > 1/3

Sample Input
