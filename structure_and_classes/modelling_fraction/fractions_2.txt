Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

interactions between objects of the same type;
providing meaningful and helpful representations of objects.
Scenario
Let's continue working on our fraction representations.

Here's what we'll be working on in this lab:

the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions;
reducing fractions to their lowest terms.
Your program should read two fractions, and then perform all the basic operations on that pair.

When displaying fractions, they should now be reduced to their lowest terms, so "2/4" should be replaced with "1/2".

To reduce the terms, it might be useful to first read about the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.

Sample Input
3 / 4
1 / 3
Expected output
3/4 + 1/3 = 1 1/12
3/4 - 1/3 = 5/12
3/4 * 1/3 = 1/4
3/4 / 1/3 = 2 1/4

Sample Input
7 / 4
-6 / 10
Expected output
1 3/4 + -6/10 = 1 3/20
1 3/4 - -6/10 = 2 7/10
1 3/4 * -6/10 = -1 1/20
1 3/4 / -6/10 = 2 11/12
