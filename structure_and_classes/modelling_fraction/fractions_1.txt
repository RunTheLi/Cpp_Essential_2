Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

modelling real-world entities with classes and objects;
providing meaningful and helpful representations of objects.
Scenario
We've already seen that floating-point numbers have their quirks in C++.

Let's try to write our own class representing non-integer numbers, namely fractions!

Our class shall, for now, provide the following functionalities:

the class will provide a textual representation;
the textual representation willdisplay whole parts correctly, i.e. 7/4 will be displayed as "1 3/4";
the textual representation will display signs correctly, i.e. -3/4 and 3/-4 will be displayed as "-3/4";
the class willprovide a floating-point representation;
the textual representation will display whole parts correctly, i.e. 7/4 will be displayed as "1 3/4";
We'll assume the denominator will not be set to 0.
Your program should allow input in the form "[numerator] / [denominator]".

Sample Input
3 / 4
Expected output
3/4 is 0.75 in decimal

Sample Input
7 / -4
Expected output
-1 3/4 is -1.75 in decimal

Sample Input
8 / 4
Expected output
2 is 2.0 in decimal

Sample Input
-6 / 8
Expected output
-6/8 is -0.75 in decimal
