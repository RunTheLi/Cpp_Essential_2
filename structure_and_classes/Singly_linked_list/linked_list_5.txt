Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

implementing data structures in C++;
traversing data structures;
keeping data structures consistent at all times.
Scenario
To make the interface somewhat symmetrical, we should add a method for removing the last element of the list.

Unfortunately, there's no simple trick to avoid traversing the list.

The tail pointer tells us which element we'll be removing, but to remove it we must modify the previous element, which we need to find, starting at the head.

Add the implementation of the pop_back method to List.
