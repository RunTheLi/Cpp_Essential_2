Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

implementing data structures in C++;
providing derived data about the implemented data structure.
Scenario
Let's continue working on our list.

One piece of information that might be useful is the size of the list.

Add the method size() to your list implementation.

As the name suggests, it should return the number of stored elements.

Expected output
pushed 0 size: 1
pushed 1 size: 2
pushed 2 size: 3
pushed 3 size: 4
pushed 4 size: 5
pushed 5 size: 6

popped 5 size: 5
popped 4 size: 4
popped 3 size: 3
