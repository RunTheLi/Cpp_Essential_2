Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

implementing data structures in C++;
traversing data structures;
accessing data stored in data structures.
Scenario
For the last part of adding, removing and accessing the data in our list, we'll provide you with a way to do all of these actions by indexing the elements in the list.

To enable this, we'll add three new methods to the List class:

at(int index) which will return the value of the element with index [index];
insert_at(int index, int value) which will insert the value at the desired index;
remove_at(int index) which will remove the value at the desired index (without returning it).
Expected output
list[0] == 1
list[1] == 2
list[2] == 3
list[3] == 4

list[0] == 1
list[1] == 2
list[2] == 4

list[0] == 1
list[1] == 6
list[2] == 2
list[3] == 4
