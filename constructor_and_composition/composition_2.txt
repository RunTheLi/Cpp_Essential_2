Scenario
Below is a recipe for constructing a primitive car. All class names start with a capital letter.

Compose a Car from some objects, you should use: one Engine, four Wheels, one Chassis, ten Lights, and one Body.

Feel free to define the attributes of these classes. Every class (including Car) must have a print method.

In the print method of Car, you just need to call the print method from all the objects.

Create one car and call a print method. Just print values for one car.
